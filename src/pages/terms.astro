      <h2>2. Content Ownership and Rights</h2>
      <p>You own any content you create and post within Aglow. By posting, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and sublicensable right to use, display, modify, adapt, and promote your content solely within the app and for promotional purposes. We will not sell your content to third parties. No harmful, illegal, offensive, or infringing content is allowed. We reserve the right to remove content that violates these terms or applicable laws.</p>

      <h2>3. Community Conduct</h2>

      <p>We may update or change the app, and these terms may also change. We will notify you of significant updates by email or in-app notification. Continued use of Aglow after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
